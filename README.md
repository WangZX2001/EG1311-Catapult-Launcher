# EG1311-Catapult-Launcher
The primary goal of this project is to build a self-powered robot that navigates an obstacle course consisting of a starting area, a bump, a ramp, and a wall and then delivers a ping-pong ball over the wall. Extra points are awarded based on the robotâ€™s weight and its capability to reverse back to the starting point.
